# RN-RadarUnder-FrontEnd

This is a React Native android project. It is RadarUnder's mobile app, which is the main channel for its services.

If cloned to a local repo, after running npm install, you have to manually parch the carousel package, importing styleprops (or similarly named) from the 'deprecated-react-native-prop-types'
package, instead of react. If not done StyleProps wont be found within React and program will exit.

Android studio must be installed to run. run with 'npx react-native run-android'
